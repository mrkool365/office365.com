# Getting Started with Command Bot with SSO

A bot, chatbot, or conversational bot is an app that responds to simple commands sent in chat and replies in meaningful ways. Examples of bots in everyday use include: bots that notify about build failures, bots that provide information about the weather or bus schedules, or provide travel information. A bot interaction can be a quick question and answer, or it can be a complex conversation. Being a cloud application, a bot can provide valuable and secure access to cloud services and corporate resources.

This is a simple command bot that implements single sign-on feature to retrieve profile and photo for currently signed-in user using Bot Framework SDK, TeamsFx SDK and Microsoft Graph API, and the commands can be found as below:

| command    | response                                          | sso command |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| helloworld | helloworld adaptive card message                  | false       |
| profile    | user profile information from Microsoft Graph API | true        |
| photo      | user photo image from Microsoft Graph API         | true        |
